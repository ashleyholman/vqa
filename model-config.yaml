###### epoch-related settings ######

# max_epochs: Training will cut off here if it hasn't already cut-off from another condition.
max_epochs: 50

# snapshot_every_epochs: How frequently to take a snapshot.  This will be the
# restore point if our run is interrupted, for example by spot instance eviction.
snapshot_every_epochs: 10

# metrics_every_epochs: How frequently to calculate performance metrics for both
# the training and validation set.  This will determine the resolution of
# graphs.  Tracking performance adds an overhead on training and requires doing
# an inference run over the validation set.
metrics_every_epochs: 1
