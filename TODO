- data analysis tooling
- explore automated stopping
- explore dynamic learning rate
- explore how to find optimal learning rate
- Implement queue for runs.  Submit config file to queue.  Implement autoscaling
  based on queue to spin up and then shut down instances based on pending runs.
- Implement automated lambda-based report generation and uploading to S3?  So I
  can just refresh my web browser to see the results.
- Check cosine similarity between raw answer embeddings to confirm clustering
  hypothesis
- run.py: Catch keyboard interrupt, set run status to USER_ABORTED
- React app:
  * Add tabs on RunDetails page:
    * performance charts
    * error analysis
  * Visualise N correct answers, N wrong answers?
- Address cloudfront caching.  How long is it?  Make it something reasonable
