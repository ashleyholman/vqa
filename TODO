- data analysis tooling
- explore automated stopping
- explore dynamic learning rate
- explore how to find optimal learning rate
- Implement queue for runs.  Submit config file to queue.  Implement autoscaling
  based on queue to spin up and then shut down instances based on pending runs.
- Implement automated lambda-based report generation and uploading to S3?  So I
  can just refresh my web browser to see the results.
- Check cosine similarity between raw answer embeddings to confirm clustering
  hypothesis
- React app:
  * Sample questions page:
    * show totals for true positive, false positive etc
  * Add confusion matrix
  * When mousing over tables, highlight the row
- Model:
  * More substitutions: eg. "playing game" -> "playing", "ones on right", "one on right" -> "on right"?
  * Try different embeddings: bert-huge and llama
